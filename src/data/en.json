    "about": "I’m a front-end developer with a background in 3D modeling and a big curiosity for how things work — visually and technically. I love the process of bringing interfaces to life with React, making sure they not only work well but feel right to use.In the past, I’ve worked with tools like Maya and Substance Painter, which taught me a lot about design, structure, and detail. That same care for detail now guides my code.I’m someone who learns quickly, stays organized, and genuinely enjoys getting better every day. There’s so much to explore in tech — and I’m excited to grow step by step. I’d love to be part of a team that’s supportive, open, and focused on creating good things together.So many interesting things out there, and only one life — let’s take the most of it :)",
